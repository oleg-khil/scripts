:reproducible:

Small programs (or rather scripts) that I wrote for myself

=== fixname

Renames the files provided via arguments after "fixing"
(removing shell-unfriendly characters, replacing them with `_`,
lower case file extensions) their names

WARNING: if a file with "fixed" name already exists, it will be quietly overwritten

=== rename2uniq

Renames the files provided via arguments to
`<random uuid without dashes>.<original file extension in lower case>`

=== mirror-git-repos

Locally mirrors remote git repositories

Requires git & git-lfs to present in PATH at runtime

The first (and only) argument is the path to the directory where the mirrors
are located

Every entry (file in directory) is processed in separate thread.

Exit code is total_error_count % 255 (if total_error_count is exactly 255,
the exit code is 255) (only exit codes 0 to 255 are valid)

If the file is a directory, then `git remote update`, `git gc`, `git lfs fetch --all`
are run in it (assuming each dir is a bare git repo initialized with `git clone
--mirror`)

If itâ€™s a regular file, the first line is read (assuming each file contains the
URL to the remote repo as the first line (only the first line is read)), the
file is renamed, bare git repo is initialized with `git clone --mirror` and then
updated with the commands above, if the cloning fails, the file is renamed back,
otherwise the file is deleted

All output (both stderr and stdout) is outputted on stdout with thread prefix
(path that thread is precessing)

This tool is intended to be run periodically via systemd timers or cron

=== archive_yt_playlist

Archives tracks from youtube playlist, downloading all missing
(locally unavailable) items

Requires `yt-dlp` to present in PATH at runtime

The first argument is the url of the youtube playlist,
the second argument is the path to the archive directory
(where all the files will be downloaded)

== Compilation

There is Nix shell, you can enter repo dir, type `nix develop` or `nix-shell` and then `make <make target>`

To build fully static binaries - `nix build` or `nix-build`

(`make` just calls cmake, so you can use cmake directly)
